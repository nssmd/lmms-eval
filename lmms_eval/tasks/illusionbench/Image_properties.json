The smoothness of the water, possibly due to a long exposure photograph, gives the canal a glassy appearance, reflecting the warm hues of the buildings in the early morning or late afternoon light. This cityscape, devoid of boats or gondolas, evokes a sense of peacefulness and a pause in time in a usually bustling city. There is no visual illusion; the image is a serene depiction of Venice's architectural beauty and charm during a quiet moment."
